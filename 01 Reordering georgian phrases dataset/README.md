My wife loves learning lenguages and sometimes asks me to help her with some data procesessing. 
The original .txt file have two columns "Columna" and "Frase". 
The first one describes different phrases categories and the column "Frase" includes phrases.
The project consist of re-organicing the information and creating an excel file where the file's columns are named after the different phases' categories.
